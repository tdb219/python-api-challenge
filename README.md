Observations can be found in the WeatherPy.ipynb file.

For quick reference, I have pasted them below:


Observations
1. Latitude and Temperature are inversely related, such that the further from the equator, the lower the temperature. This is supported by the overall visual trend, as well as the slope values in the regression analyses being negative for the northern hemisphere and positive for the southern hemisphereÂ¶

2. Latitude and Cloudiness are positively related, such that the further from the equator, the greater the cloudiness. This is likely due to the cooler temperatures further away from the equator, allowing for moisture to more easily condense in the atmosphere and create clouds with greater stability.

3. Latitude does not appear to have much of an effect on wind speed, but wind speed does increase slightly further from the equator. This may be attributed to air blending between climate zones.
